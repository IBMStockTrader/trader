# Pipeline install
* Select the OCP project you want to use this in using `oc project <project>` e.g. `oc project stock-trader`
* Run `oc apply -f pipeline-template.yaml`
* Run `oc new-app --template=stocktrader-trader-pipeline  -p GIT_SOURCE_URL=https://github.com/IBMStockTrader/ -p GIT_SOURCE_REF=master`
* Install the trader app using the yaml from `manifests/deploy-openshift.yaml` which includes a `DeploymentConfig`
  * Change the `namespace` field in line 22 and the namespace in the path of the Docker registry in line 36 of the file to the namespace where your `ImageStream` is deployed to
* You should now have a BuildConfig called `stocktrader-trader` and a ImageStream in your OCP project

# Github Webhook for the pipeline
After applying the pipeline file, you have to create a secret. This can be easily done from the CLI for testing purposes:
* execute (repalce <your secret> by a random string) `oc create secret generic github-webhook --from-literal=WebHookSecretKey=<your secret>`
* execute `oc describe bc stocktrader-trader`
* note down the webhook url and replace <secret> with <your secret>
* configure a webhook as described here: https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/
